# navx_ros

Creates a ROS node that publishes to IMU.msg. <br />
Based off of FRC Team 900's [repository](https://github.com/FRC900/navXTimeSync)

## Directions for installing

1) Clone this project to your catkin's workspace src folder
2) Navigate into navx_ros directory and run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`

## Direction for testing/visualizing

1) Install rviz_imu_plugin: [roswiki](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz_imu_plugin), [github](https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/imu_tools)
2) Start the imu node (including roscore) and run `rosrun rviz rviz`
3) Navigate to the bottom left corner and click 'add' and scroll down and add `Imu` under the 'rviz_imu_plugin' folder
4) On the left Display panel, add the IMU topic (default should be `/Imu`) and change the 'Fixed Frame' variable to `imu`
5) Change the settings for the box, axes, and acceleration as needed


## Setting up udev rules
With all of the other sensors attached to the computer, the order in which the sensors are mounted can change, therefore changing their names. Therefore, the script `create_udev_rules.sh` should be used to assign a unique name to the IMU. After running the script, the IMU should show up as /dev/navx.
